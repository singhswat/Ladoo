# 🎁 GiftBox — A Financial Gifting Marketplace  
**Gift wealth that grows — not things that fade.**

GiftBox is a simple, beautiful way for parents and families to gift stocks, rupee amounts, SIPs, and themed investment baskets to children.  
All transfers are executed securely through licensed brokers via demat-to-demat transfers.
